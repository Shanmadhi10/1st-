#Define a class named Book with attributes title, author, and num_pages.
#The title attribute should store the title of the book as a string, the author attribute should store 
#the author's name as a string, and the num_pages attribute should store the number of pages in the book as an integer. 
#Within this class, include a method short_description() that returns a string in the format "'[title]' by [author]". 
#Additionally, include a method is_lengthy() that returns True if the book has more than 300 pages, 
#otherwise it should return False.
